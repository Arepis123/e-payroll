# Client/Contractor Prototype Summary

## Overview
Successfully created a complete mockup prototype for client/contractor users in the e-payroll system. This prototype runs parallel to the existing admin interface with role-based access control.

## What Was Built

### 1. Database Schema
- Added `role` column to users table (default: 'client', options: 'admin', 'client')
- Added `company_name` column for client company information
- Added `phone` column for client contact information

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- Created `RoleMiddleware` to enforce role-based permissions
- Registered middleware in `bootstrap/app.php` as 'role'
- Applied middleware to all admin and client routes
- Admin routes require `role:admin` middleware
- Client routes require `role:client` middleware

### 3. Routes Structure

#### Admin Routes (prefix: `/admin`)
- `/admin/dashboard` - Admin dashboard
- `/admin/worker` - Worker management
- `/admin/salary` - Salary management
- `/admin/report` - Reports

#### Client Routes (prefix: `/client`)
- `/client/dashboard` - Client dashboard with overview
- `/client/workers` - View assigned workers
- `/client/payments` - Payment history
- `/client/invoices` - Invoice management
- `/client/timesheet` - Timesheet submission

### 4. Client Views Created

#### Dashboard (`client/dashboard.blade.php`)
Features:
- Statistics cards (My Workers, This Month Payment, Pending Approvals, Paid This Year)
- Quick list of assigned workers
- Recent payment history
- Quick action buttons (Submit Timesheet, View Workers, View Invoices)
- Notifications panel
- Company information display

#### Workers Page (`client/workers.blade.php`)
Features:

- Worker list table with:
  - Employee ID
  - Name with avatar
  - IC Number
  - Position
  - Basic Salary
  - Status badges
  - Action dropdown (View Details, View Payslips)

#### Payments Page (`client/payments.blade.php`)
Features:
- Payment statistics (This Month, Last Month, This Year, Average Monthly)
- Payment history table with:
  - Payment ID
  - Month
  - Amount
  - Number of workers
  - Payment date
  - Status badges
  - View action button
- Year filter dropdown
- Export functionality

#### Invoices Page (`client/invoices.blade.php`)
Features:
- Invoice statistics (Pending, Paid, Total Invoiced)
- Invoice list table with:
  - Invoice number
  - Month
  - Amount
  - Issue date
  - Due date
  - Status badges
  - View and Download actions

#### Timesheet Page (`client/timesheet.blade.php`)
Features:
- Current month submission status with deadline
- Statistics (Total Workers, Working Days, Total Hours, Overtime Hours)
- Editable timesheet table with:
  - Worker information
  - Days worked input
  - Regular hours input
  - Overtime hours input
  - Leave days input
  - Status indicators
- Month selector
- Import from Excel functionality
- Save draft and submit buttons
- Submission history table

### 5. Client Sidebar Layout
Created dedicated sidebar for client portal (`client-sidebar.blade.php`) with:
- "CLIENT PORTAL" header
- Navigation items:
  - Dashboard (house icon)
  - My Workers (users icon)
  - Payments (wallet icon)
  - Invoices (document-text icon)
  - Timesheet (calendar icon)
- Settings link
- User profile dropdown with logout

### 6. Layout Auto-Detection
Modified `app.blade.php` to automatically use:
- Client sidebar for users with role = 'client'
- Admin sidebar for users with role = 'admin'

## Design Patterns Used

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   - Middleware-based authorization
   - Route-level protection
   - View-level conditional rendering

2. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - Flux UI components
   - Blade components for layouts
   - Reusable card and table components

3. **Consistent UI/UX**
   - Same dark mode support as admin
   - Consistent color scheme and typography
   - Responsive design with mobile support
   - Statistics cards pattern
   - Table layouts with actions

## Testing the Prototype

### For Admin Users
1. Set user role to 'admin' in database
2. Login and navigate to `/admin/dashboard`
3. Access admin features (Worker, Salary, Report)

### For Client Users
1. Set user role to 'client' in database
2. Optionally set `company_name` and `phone` fields
3. Login and navigate to `/client/dashboard`
4. Access client features (Workers, Payments, Invoices, Timesheet)

## Next Steps (Not Implemented - Mockup Only)

The following are mockup features that would need backend implementation:

1. **Database Models**
   - Client model with relationships
   - Worker-Client relationship
   - Payment records
   - Invoice generation
   - Timesheet submissions

2. **Backend Logic**
   - Worker assignment to clients
   - Payment processing
   - Invoice generation
   - Timesheet approval workflow
   - Email notifications

3. **API Integration**
   - Real-time data fetching
   - Form submissions
   - File uploads (Excel import)
   - PDF generation (invoices)

4. **Authentication Flow**
   - Client registration
   - Email verification
   - Password reset
   - Company profile setup

## Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Laravel 12
- **Frontend**: Livewire 3 + Flux/Flux Pro UI
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Database**: MariaDB
- **Authentication**: Laravel Breeze with role extensions

## Notes

- All data shown is mockup/demo data
- Forms are not yet connected to backend
- File uploads are UI-only
- Charts and statistics are hardcoded
- Worker lists show sample data only
- The prototype demonstrates the complete user interface and navigation flow
