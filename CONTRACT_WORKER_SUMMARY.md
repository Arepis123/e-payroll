# Contract Worker Implementation Summary

## ⚠️ Important: Read-Only Access

**This payroll system has READ-ONLY access to the `contract_worker` table.**

Another system manages contract data (creating, updating, deleting contracts). This payroll system only:
- ✅ Reads contract data
- ✅ Filters workers based on active contracts
- ✅ Displays contract information
- ❌ Does NOT create/update/delete contracts

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. **ContractWorker Model** (`app/Models/ContractWorker.php`)
- Full Eloquent model for `contract_worker` table (READ-ONLY)
- Relationships to `Contractor` and `Worker` models
- Scopes for filtering: `active()`, `expired()`, `byContractor()`, `byWorker()`
- Helper methods: `isActive()`, `isExpired()`, `daysRemaining()`
- Accessors for clean property access

### 2. **Updated Contractor Model** (`app/Models/Contractor.php`)
Added new relationships:
- `contractedWorkers()` - Get workers through contract_worker (hasManyThrough)
- `contracts()` - Get contract records (hasMany)
- `activeContractedWorkers()` - Get only active contracted workers

### 3. **Updated Worker Model** (`app/Models/Worker.php`)
Added new relationships:
- `contracts()` - Get all contract records for this worker
- `activeContract()` - Get current active contract
- `hasActiveContract()` - Check if worker has active contract

### 4. **ContractWorkerService** (`app/Services/ContractWorkerService.php`)
Full service layer with caching for:
- Getting active contracts
- Getting contracts by contractor
- Getting contracted workers (filtered by contract_worker)
- Getting contractors with active contracts
- Contract statistics
- Searching contracts
- Expiry notifications (contracts expiring soon)
- Cache invalidation methods

### 5. **Documentation**
- `CONTRACT_WORKER_GUIDE.md` - Complete usage guide with examples
- `SECOND_DATABASE_MAPPING.md` - Field mapping reference
- Test command for verification

### 6. **Test Commands**
- `php artisan db:view-contract-worker` - View contract_worker table
- `php artisan test:contract-worker` - Test all functionality

## 🎯 How to Use in Your Application

### For Client/Contractor Portal

When a contractor logs in, show their contracted workers:

```php
use App\Services\ContractWorkerService;

public function dashboard()
{
    $service = new ContractWorkerService();

    // Get logged-in contractor's CLAB number
    $clabNo = auth()->user()->contractor_clab_no; // Adjust based on your user table

    // Get their contracted workers
    $workers = $service->getContractedWorkers($clabNo);

    // Get contract statistics
    $stats = $service->getContractStatistics();

    return view('client.dashboard', compact('workers', 'stats'));
}
```

### For Admin Portal

View all contractors with active contracts:

```php
use App\Services\ContractWorkerService;

public function contractors()
{
    $service = new ContractWorkerService();

    // Get all contractors with active contracts
    $contractors = $service->getContractorsWithActiveContracts();

    // Get overall statistics
    $stats = $service->getContractStatistics();

    return view('admin.contractors', compact('contractors', 'stats'));
}
```

### For Payroll Processing

Only process workers with active contracts:

```php
use App\Services\ContractWorkerService;

public function processPayroll()
{
    $service = new ContractWorkerService();

    // Get all active contracts
    $contracts = $service->getActiveContracts();

    foreach ($contracts as $contract) {
        $worker = $contract->worker;
        $contractor = $contract->contractor;

        // Process payroll for this worker
        $this->calculateSalary($worker, $contractor, $contract);
    }
}
```

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### 1. Filtering Strategy

Your system now has **two levels of data**:

**Level 1: Second Database (worker_db)**
- 5,809 contractors
- 69,726 workers
- **All** historical and current data

**Level 2: Contract Worker Table**
- Only relevant contractor-worker pairs
- Only workers currently contracted
- Filters down to manageable dataset

**Example:**
```php
// This gets ALL workers from worker_db (69,726 workers!)
$allWorkers = Worker::all(); // ❌ Don't use this

// This gets ONLY contracted workers (3 workers in your case)
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$contractedWorkers = $service->getContractedWorkers($clabNo); // ✅ Use this
```

### 2. Active vs Inactive Contracts

A contract is **active** if:
- `con_end >= today`

A contract is **expired** if:
- `con_end < today`

When a contract expires, the worker automatically disappears from your active worker list (but data remains in the database for history).

### 3. Relationship Types

**Direct Relationship (from worker_db):**
```php
$contractor->workers; // All workers with wkr_currentemp = CLAB number
```

**Through Contract Worker (filtered):**
```php
$contractor->contractedWorkers; // Only workers in contract_worker table
```

**Always use the contracted relationship for payroll operations!**

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Update User Authentication

Add contractor CLAB number to your users table so contractors can log in and see their workers:

```php
// In migration
$table->string('contractor_clab_no')->nullable();
```

### 2. ~~Create Contract Management Interface~~ ❌ Not Needed

Contract management is handled by another system. This payroll system only needs to:
- ✅ View active contracts
- ✅ Display contract information
- ✅ Show expiring contract warnings (read-only alerts)

### 3. Integrate with Payroll

Update your payroll processing to use ContractWorkerService:
- Only process workers with active contracts
- Calculate salaries based on contract period
- Track contract expiry for warnings

### 4. Add Contract Notifications

Create notifications for:
- Contracts expiring in 30 days
- Contracts expiring in 7 days
- Contracts that just expired

Example:
```php
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$expiring = $service->getExpiringContracts(30);

foreach ($expiring as $contract) {
    // Send notification to admin/contractor
    Notification::send($admin, new ContractExpiryNotification($contract));
}
```

### 5. Update Client Dashboard Views

Update your client dashboard mockup to show real data:

**Replace this:**
```php
// Mockup data
$workers = [
    ['name' => 'John Doe', ...],
];
```

**With this:**
```php
// Real data
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$clabNo = auth()->user()->contractor_clab_no;
$workers = $service->getContractedWorkers($clabNo);
```

## 🎓 Quick Reference

### Get Contracted Workers for a Contractor
```php
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$workers = $service->getContractedWorkers('CLAB005617');
```

### Check if Worker has Active Contract
```php
$worker = Worker::find(133951);
if ($worker->hasActiveContract()) {
    // Worker has active contract
}
```

### Get Contract Statistics
```php
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$stats = $service->getContractStatistics();
// Returns: total_contracts, active_contracts, active_workers, etc.
```

### Get Contracts Expiring Soon
```php
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$expiring = $service->getExpiringContracts(30); // Next 30 days
```

### Get Contractors with Active Contracts
```php
$service = new ContractWorkerService();
$contractors = $service->getContractorsWithActiveContracts();
```
